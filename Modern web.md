# Tools for developing Modern Web
Hi, i'm Manish Gowardipe. welcome to [Modern web].
The Goal of this write up is to point out which tools could be considered while developing websites while giving importance to developer experience as well. Importance on reducing abstractions and complexity.

### Modern Web. What does it really mean ? why do UI developers need to bother about it ?

Web development has come really long way which initiated in early 1990's that's when people started using html & javascript heavily to build their websites. Gradually developers started abstracting things out. Giving life to [[W3C]] Standards, Tools (like Microsoft Front Page Express, Netsacpe DreamWeaver etc), techniques & libraries to make developer's life easier.

Cut to 2021, we still mainly use HTML & Javascript in browser along with CSS to build website. 


Anything other than html, js & css should be considered only if it provides significant benefit to User Experience and/or Developer Experience.

But over the time, people started using various programs/tools/standards to improve thier productivity as well as to build **better** website's.  By better i mean, Using standards defined by [[W3C]]  to build website's that are  accessible to wide range of users (geographically / disabled) & also to build site's that are responsive (Contents changes layout based on the aspect ratio of viewport).

For these above reasons & many more reasons that involves various things ranging from how to design which impacts look & feel, user's accessibility on the screen, etc.

## What is so modern about it ? 
There are some sensible defaults which have emerged in Websites / WebApps, which should considered before making it public.
### Responsive
		Websites should behave properly on various screens/viewports as users nowadays have access to devices with different screen sizes.
